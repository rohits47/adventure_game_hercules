You are Hercules! The ancient greek god Zeus is your father, 
but to get to Mount Olympus and join the ranks of gods, you must complete certain tasks. 
You must:
- Kill the Nemean Lion, take its hide, and give it to Hades
- Capture Cerberus and give him to Hades
- Take the golden horns of the minotaur and give them to Hades
- Acquire the head of Medusa and give it to Hades
- Take Zeus's Lighting bolt from the Hydra without dying and try to give it to Hades
Your tasks will be made difficult by the various archaic creatures that haunt the world. 
Also, it is impossible to get to the underworld by foot, hence Hercules must fly there.
In addition, it will be impossible to kill monsters or people without a sword. If Hercules loses his sword, 
he must get it before killing anyone.
When you try to give Zeus's lightning bolt to Hades, Hades will send you to Mount Olympus, 
where you will take the tonic of immortality from Zeus, give him his lightning bolt, and become a god, winning the game.
